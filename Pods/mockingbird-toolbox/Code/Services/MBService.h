/*!
 The `MBService` protocol is implemented by classes that provide runtime 
 services that might not need to be running during the entire lifetime of the 
 application.

 For example, an application might not want to start the `MBGeolocationService`
 until the user takes an action that requires location information. This will
 ensure that the user isn't prompted by iOS for Location Services permission 
 until absolutely necessary.
 
 Also, because the use of Location Services can increase battery drain, by
 being implemented as a service, `MBGeolocationService` can be turned off when
 not in need.
 
 This is more respectful of the user's resources.

 @warning This protocol declares methods that are intended to be called *only*
 by the `MBServiceManager`. Do not call these methods directly. To make use of
 a service, you should use methods provided by the `MBServiceManager` singleton.
